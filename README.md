# Haskell Lazy Evaluation Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Haskell related to lazy evaluation and the use of `foldr` with potentially infinite lists. The `bug.hs` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version. The issue arises from the fact that `foldr` processes the list from right to left, leading to a stack overflow when applied to a large or infinite sequence due to the recursive nature of the function. The solution utilizes a more efficient approach that avoids this problem, offering a robust and performant method for summing squares in such scenarios.  This illustrates the importance of understanding lazy evaluation's implications in Haskell programming.
