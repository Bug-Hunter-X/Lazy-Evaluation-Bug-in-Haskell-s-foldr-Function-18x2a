This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and how `foldr` interacts with infinite lists.  The function `sumSquares` aims to compute the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n. However, if n is very large or infinite, it will cause a stack overflow because of the way Haskell's lazy evaluation works. The `foldr` function recursively processes its input list from right to left.  If the input is an infinite list, the rightmost element will never be reached, and the program will never terminate.
